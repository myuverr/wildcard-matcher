# Enable sorting of #include directives.
SortIncludes: true

# Defines the categorization and sorting priority for #include directives.
# clang-format automatically assigns priority 0 to the main include file
# (e.g., for 'foo.cpp', 'foo.h' is the main include).
IncludeCategories:
  # Priority 1: C system headers (e.g., <stdio.h>, <sys/types.h>).
  # These are matched by the '.h' extension and angle brackets.
  - Regex: '(^<[^/]*\.h>$|^<(sys|arpa|net|netinet)/.*\.h>)$'
    Priority: 1

  # Priority 2: C++ standard library headers (e.g., <vector>, <string>).
  # These are matched by not containing a '.' and being in angle brackets.
  - Regex: "^<[^.]*>$"
    Priority: 2

  # Priority 3: Other library headers (third-party) included with angle brackets
  # (e.g., <gtest/gtest.h>).
  - Regex: "^<.*>$"
    Priority: 3

  # Priority 4: Project-specific headers included with quotes (e.g., "my_project/utils.h").
  - Regex: '^".*"'
    Priority: 4
